It is a good idea to create open source website (GitHub) mix with 80000hours org website idea, where there are 7 sections 
1. Guide to open source 
2. Learning tool e.g. Python,  Git etc with exercise 
3. Problem profile (rank by possible to solve, matter for many people and neglected)
4. Learning math (mostly practical math, with exercise) e.g. DSA, Linear Algebra etc.
5. Project (with GitHub website, grouped by similar problem scope)
6. Forum 
7. Podcast and video

So it is similar to 80000hours, but it is suitable for people who want to have a positive impact now by creating useful software, 
instead of just find the long term career path as 80000hours guide. 
Another inspiration is that I want to encourage project based learning, 
so student (and other people) have better learning experience. 

I have 2 names for this project 
1. SCP (Solvable Collaborative Problem)
2. P&NP (Problem and Neglected Problem)
